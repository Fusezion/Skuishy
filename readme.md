This addon is just a random addon I made to support/add random little things I thought would be nice to have in skript that for whatever reason any other addon doesn't have. I am always taking suggestions for syntaxes! Either message me on skUnity or join my Discord (I am more active on discord)


For any support or suggestions, join my Discord here!

If you are instead looking for source code or a list of all syntaxes visit my GitHub page here!

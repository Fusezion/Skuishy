This addon is just a random addon I made to support/add random little things I thought would be nice to have in skript that for whatever reason any other GOOD addon doesn't have. I am always taking suggestions for syntaxes! Either message me on skUnity or join my Discord (I am more active on discord)

If SkriptLang team wants to use whatever is in my addon, you can.
